Code for Creating a Loom Image from a Digital Image

Note: I have only made slight changes to write the line paths to a csv file. This is primarily for use within Tableau. I am not an experienced Java developer, so my code may not be the best or most elegant possible, but it works.

Original code had a version for Arduino, but I have removed that as I have only worked with the code for Processing.

To run this code, you'll need Processing (https://processing.org/download/). Open the PDE file in Processing, then follow the instructions in the file.
